1. lecture 1 (2015-10-02) introduction, discussion of insert sort,
line-by-line estimate of run time. O(n^2) mentioned. Based on
1_introduction pages 1-5.

2. lecture 2 (2015-10-07) recap of insert sort, definition of O(g(n))
with some examples. Discussion of log_2 n, of n! and 2^n. Searching an
ordered list, linear search, binary search. Binary search is O(log
n). Based on 2_big_oh and 3_search.

3. lecture 3 (2015-10-14) Recap of big-Oh. Discussion of recursion,
including tail recursion and the stack. Based on 4_recursion.

4. lecture 4 (2015-10-21) recursion again, discussion and examples of calculating the run time. Telescoping and ansatze for solving recursion relations; start of the master theorem. Based on 4_recursion and 5_master.

5. lecture 5 (2015-10-28) the master theorem again, some examples. The
Fibonacci sequence, solution, run time. Sorting: discussion of the
memory use for insert sort. Fire alarm. Based on 5_mast and
6_fibonacci, very start of 7_quicksort.
