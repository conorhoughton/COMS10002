The AVL tree contains a function called "latex_print" which creates a
latex file which draws the tree. For this to work you need to have
installed the tikz package; in the ubuntu repositories this is
included in the texlive-picture package, for example. In AVL_tree.c
latex_print is called with the argument "tree.tex" so it creates a
file called tree.tex, running

pdflatex tree.tex

should make a pdf called tree.pdf which will show the tree.
