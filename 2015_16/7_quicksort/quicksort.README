 In this version of quicksort it doesn't choose the three values for
 median of threes randomly, it assumes the data is already random and
 picks the first two and the last. If this is not the case then some
 sort of randomization is needed. For exmaple, maybe the first and
 last entry could be chosen, along with a random entry in between,
 this would be achieved by using

 
int random_middle=first+1+rand()%(last-first-1);
swap(a,median(a,first,first+random,last),last);
