Here r keeps track of how many elements at the end are already sorted
so it reduces the size of the inner loop.

Many versions of bubble sort don't bother with the "unfinished" flag,
considering the run time expense of setting it every time there is a
swap it might be quicker to replace the while loop with a for loop
that goes through the list n times.
