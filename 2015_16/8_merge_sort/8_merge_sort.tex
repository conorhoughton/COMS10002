\subsection*{8 - merge sort}

In a way quicksort pushes \lq{}sortedness\rq{} downwards, each time it
splits the array of entries it divides them into a lower and upper
group so that when the process reaches the bottom, with one or two
element sub-arrays, the whole array is sorted. Merge sort, sometimes
called mergesort, works the other way, sorting the subarrays as it
merges them together. It was invented in 1945 by John van Neumann, a towering
figure in mid-C20 computer science and mathematics. It works because
merging two sorted arrays into another sorted array is an $O(n)$
operation.

We will examine the merge operation first; this involves two ordered
arrays, to be merged, and a extra array for putting the merged
elements. There is a marker for each of the order arrays, say $i$ and
$j$, these both start at the low end of there arrays and the elements
at $i$ and at $j$ are compared, the lower is added to the merged
arrays and the corresponding marker is moved forward one. This keeps
going until one of the markers reaches the end of its list, when that
happens all the remaining elements of the other array are added to the
merged array. Code to do this is given in Table~\ref{c_merge}; in this
code the two sorted arrays that need to be merged are consequitive
subarrays marked by \texttt{first} to \texttt{mid-1} and \texttt{mid} to \texttt{last}.


\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
void merge(int a[], int merged_a[], int first, int mid, int last)
{
   int last_lower=mid-1,i=first,j=mid,merged_i=first;

   while(i<=last_lower&&j<=last)
      if(a[i]<a[j]){
         merged_a[merged_i]=a[i];
	 i++;
	 merged_i++;
      }
      else{
	 merged_a[merged_i]=a[j];
	 j++;
	 merged_i++;
      }

   while(i<=last_lower){
      merged_a[merged_i]=a[i];
      i++;
      merged_i++;
   }

   while(j<=last){
      merged_a[merged_i]=a[j];
      j++;
      merged_i++;
   }

   for(i=first;i<=last;i++)
      a[i]=merged_a[i];
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Merging. This merges the elements from first to mid-1 and mid
  to last under the assumption that they are already sorted, to give a
  merged array from first to last of merged\_a, these elements are
  then copied back to elements first to last of a. This function is
  part of the full merge sort program {\tt
    merge\_sort.c}. \label{c_merge}}
\end{table}

Now that that is done, it is easy to do merge sort, basically at each
stage the array is split in two and merge sort is called on each half,
when these return they are merged using the merge function. The
recursion terminates on a single element list. A function for doing
this is given in Table~\ref{c_merge_sort} and a rough example is given
in Table~\ref{table_merge_sort}.

Merge sort does the same thing no matter what order the entries are in
to start with. The run times can be calculated from the recursion,
ignoring the small effect from $n$ not always begin even
\begin{equation}
T(n)=cn+2T(n/2)
\end{equation}
where the $cn$ corresponds to the merge. This is the same recursion as
for the quicksort, so merge sort is $O(n\log{n})$ with the difference
here that this is the run time no matter what. The algorithm, as
implemented here, needs another array the same length as the original
one, for doing the merges into; thus, the extra memory use is
$O(n)$. This can be beaten, there are implementations with smaller
memory use, even implementations that run in place, but they are more
complicated. Parallel processing works well with merge sort and there
are efficient sort algorithms based on a mixture of merge sort and
insert sort.

\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
void merge_sort_r(int a[], int merged_a[],int first, int last)
{
   if(last-first<=0)
     return;

   int mid=(last+first)/2+1;

   merge_sort_r(a, merged_a,first,mid-1);
   merge_sort_r(a, merged_a,mid,last);

   merge(a, merged_a, first, mid, last);

   return;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Merge sort. This splits the array, calls itself recursively
  on the two parts and then merges them. It can be found as part of
  {\tt merge\_sort.c}, this also includes the wrapper and so
  on. \label{c_merge_sort}}

  sorting, the vertical line represents the different subarrays. This
  table is very schematic, it doesn't really show the order things
  happen, and it shows things happening to different subarrays
  simulataneously, when, they don't actually happen like
  that.\label{table_merge_sort}}
