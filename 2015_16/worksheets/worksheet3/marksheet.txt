Marking sheet.

Base mark (tick the best category that applies to your program):

A: 
   _   0%   Nothing

   _   5%   A program which does not compile.

   _  15%   A working program that does not give the right output
            i.e. it compiles, it reads the text file, and prompts for 
            queries, but it does not give the right number of occurrences 
            for a given keyword.

   _  25%   A working program implementing the linked list approach. Your 
            program gives the right number of occurrences for the test
            keywords named on the assignment sheet. 

   _  50%   A working program implementing the linked list approach and the
            hash table approach. Your program gives the right number of 
            occurrences for the test keywords named on the assignment sheet.
            
   _  60%   A working program implementing the linked list approach and
            the hash table approach. In addition it give the size of
            the hash table, the number of empty indexes, what
            percentage of the hash table is used and
            the maximum length of a linked list.

   _  65%   A working program as described in 60%, but one which also works
            out how many comparisons were required during retrieval using the 
            linked list and using the hash table.

Tick any of the following if appropriate:

B: _  10%   You have commented your code properly.  This means every
            function is clearly defined as an operation, an input and
            corresponding output set.

C: _  5%   Your program has proper indentation. Indentation is
            consistent throughout your code, empty lines are used
	    consistently. For example, either you use an empty line
	    between every two functions, or you never have an empty line
	    between two functions.

D: _  10%   You have defined constants and types, and declared variables 
            using names which clearly indicate their use.

E: _  10%   You do not use global variables, and functions and loops
            are used properly. In particular, there is no duplicated
	    code anywhere.
