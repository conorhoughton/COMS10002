Marking sheet.

Base mark (tick the best category that applies to your program):

A: 
   _   0%   Nothing

   _   5%   A program which does not compile.

   _  15%   A working program that does not give the right output
            i.e. it compiles, it reads the text file, and prompts for 
            queries, but it does not give the right number of occurrences 
            for a given keyword.

   _  25%   A working program implementing the linked list approach. Your 
            program gives the right number of occurrences for the test
            keywords named on the assignment sheet. 

   _  50%   A working program implementing the linked list approach and the
            hash table approach. Your program gives the right number of 
            occurrences for the test keywords named on the assignment sheet.
            
   _  55%   A working program implementing the linked list approach and the
            hash table approach. You have chosen the size of the hash table to
	    suit the text. 

   _  60%   A working program implementing the linked list approach and
            the hash table approach. You have implemented the hash
            table as abstract data type (data structure and a set of
            operations on it).

Tick any of the following if appropriate:

B: _  10%   You have commented your code properly.  This means every
            function is clearly defined as an operation, an input and
            corresponding output set.

C: _  10%   Your program has proper indentation. Indentation is
            consistent throughout your code, empty lines are used
	    consistently. For example, either you use an empty line
	    between every two functions, or you never have an empty line
	    between two functions.

D: _  10%   You have defined constants and types, and declared variables 
            using names which clearly indicate their use.

E: _  10%   You do not use global variables, and functions and loops
            are used properly. In particular, there is no duplicated
	    code anywhere. If you have used a "COPY AND PASTE" feature
	    of your editor, than it is likely that you have duplicated
	    code, and that you cannot tick this box.
