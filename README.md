Programming and Algorithms COMS10002 is a course taught to students
studying computer science at Bristol University. It teaches C, Haskell
and Algorithms. The course material for the algorithms portion of the
course will appear here.

The forlder 2015_16 will contain the notes and other material for the
course as it is taught in the academic year 2015-16. 

The folder 2012_13 contains the notes for COMS11600 Principles of
Programming which I taught in 2012-13, it contains a lot of the same
material that I will be including in my section of COMS10002.
