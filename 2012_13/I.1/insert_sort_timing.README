1) The package time.h has stuff for timing, this comes with its own
data type, clock_t, this gets cast to a double when calculating
time_spent

2) Sort is too quick for the precision of timing, so I do 1000
trials. Hopefully this will average over some of the background
fluctuations in run speed because of background processes.
