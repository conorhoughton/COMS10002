This program uses the maths package math.h, this includes the log10
function used to calculated the number of significant figures and the
pow for working out the exponent. The corresponding .o file needs to
be linked at compile time, in gcc this is done using -lm by writing

gcc radix_sort.c -o radix -lm

There are other ways of doing this, for example by running the loop
until digit exceeds a_bound.

CONSIDER ADDING THIS MODIFICATION YOURSELF, MAKE IT SO THAT math.h
ISN'T NEEDED.
