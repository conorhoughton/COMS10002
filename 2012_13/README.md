Lecture notes and other files for my course COMS11600 - Principles of
Programming, an introductary course in algorithms for first year CS
students at Bristol University. I taught this course in 2012-13.

The folder "Notes" contains pdfs for the different sections of the
course, the corresponding folders contain the code mentioned in the
notes along with things like tex files.

I offer a small bounty of between 10p and 2GBP for typos and mistakes,
if you spot some let me know.

This course no longer exists - the material has been including in
Programming and Algorithms I COMS10002.
